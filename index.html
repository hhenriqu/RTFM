      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p>
        Hello World! I'm a challenges and technology lover, and I belive that
        nothing is more challenging than facing this giant wave that we call
        technological evolution. Currently I'm studying Software Engineering,
        Front-end and Back-end Languages ​​(HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, C, C# and
        others). After years working in other areas of my first graduate and in
        other areas that contributed a lot to my professional and personal
        learn. I decided to make a career transition to an area that I've always
        been passionate about, but due to priorities they didn't fit in my life,
        now I'm taking my first steps in search of an opportunity to continue
        growing.
